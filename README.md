🔒 Artemis Financial – Secure Software Development Project

This repository contains my completed Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment and supporting documentation for the CS Portfolio. The project demonstrates my ability to identify, assess, and remediate software vulnerabilities through secure coding practices, encryption, and dependency management. It showcases hands-on experience with OWASP tools, SSL testing, and secure code refactoring to meet modern cybersecurity standards.
🛡️ Artemis Financial – Portfolio Artifact
📘 Client Overview

Artemis Financial is a financial services company focused on providing secure transaction and client data management solutions. The client requested a comprehensive evaluation of its software to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with secure coding standards. My role was to perform a vulnerability assessment, refactor insecure code, and recommend best practices to strengthen the company’s cybersecurity framework.

💡 What I Did Well

I successfully identified software security vulnerabilities and applied secure coding principles to mitigate them. Writing secure code is vital because it protects sensitive data, prevents breaches, and maintains user trust. Implementing secure coding practices adds long-term value to a company by ensuring the stability and integrity of its systems. This project reinforced the importance of proactively managing dependencies and encrypting communication channels to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.

⚙️ Challenges and Insights

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was analyzing the risk level of each finding and determining appropriate mitigation techniques. However, this process was also one of the most rewarding aspects, as it helped me understand the importance of prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and applying layered security controls.

🔐 Security Enhancements

I enhanced security by updating outdated libraries, enforcing HTTPS, and implementing stronger encryption protocols. In future projects, I plan to use tools such as OWASP Dependency Check, Burp Suite, and automated CI/CD pipeline scanning to identify and mitigate risks early in the development cycle.

✅ Ensuring Functionality and Security

After refactoring the code, I tested it thoroughly to confirm it remained both functional and secure. I re-ran vulnerability scans to ensure no new issues were introduced. Regular validation and secure code reviews were key to maintaining the application’s integrity.

🧰 Tools and Practices Used

OWASP Dependency Check for identifying vulnerable dependencies

SSL Labs for testing HTTPS and certificate configurations

Secure API handling and encryption implementation

Refactoring for input validation and error handling

💼 Value to Employers

This project highlights my ability to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities, apply secure coding techniques, and validate functionality post-refactor. It demonstrates a solid understanding of practical cybersecurity principles that align with modern software development practices. Employers can view this as proof of my commitment to producing secure, reliable, and high-quality software.
